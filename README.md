# CookingWebsite
This is the project i created for my final exam in the SoftUni's Django Web Framework course.
A fully functional website for cooking recipes sharing.
It has a login/register functionality.
Every user has full control on the recipes he/she posts.
The admins also have control on everything the regular users post.
